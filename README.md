If you're new to Python, I hope these 100+ exercises will assist you in getting your hands on the programming.

The tasks are basic and quick to solve. A newbie should attempt 4-5 problems every day, which will take some time to complete but will undoubtedly teach them something new (no matter how lazy you are :P ). And after only a month of consistent practise, one may easily complete more than 100++ problems, which is unquestionably impressive.
